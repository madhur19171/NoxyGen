# KnockGen

This is an Network On Chip netlist generator. The netlist generated is in verilog.
This project is a part of Computer Architecture course project, IIITD, 2021.


## Installing and Running
For "delay" branch
 1. To install this program, clone this repository and it's submodules.
 2. Make dot2hdl project and add the binary to your path. dot2hdl is a subset of Dynamatic that we have extended and use for our project.
 3. Write a NoC description file in DOT. You can take hints from the dot files already present in the project.
 4. In the command line, type "dot2hdl \<DotFile Name\>" . The NoC netlist along with Routing Tables will be generated.
 5. Move the Routing tables in a folder named "RoutingTable"
 6. Copy the library files from Verilog folder and change the routing table path in HeadFlitDecoder.v file
 7. Use "generator" program from "tr" branch to generate a Testbench.
 8. Write input stimuli in separate Nodes\<number>\.dat files and place them in sim/sim/INPUT_VECOTRS/ folder.
 9. Run the testbench using iverilog/ModelSim/Vivado or any Verilog Simulator.
